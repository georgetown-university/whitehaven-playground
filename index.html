    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p>A more flexible way to implement calls-to-action is to use Buttons. Full documentation is available on <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Buttons</a>, but here are some examples.</p>
    <p>Buttons are best used in Cards to provide a call-to-action, but can also be used alone in Primary or Secondary Body when attention is needed for a link.</p>
    <p>Buttons may also include additional code for icons, as illustrated here and described in more detail in the Icon section below.</p>

  <section data-doc="cards">
    <h2>Cards</h2>
    <p>A more flexible way to implement callouts is to use Cards. Full documentation is available on <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Cards</a>, including Card Decks, but here are some examples based on GUâ€™s current callout styles. The Card functionality allows you to mix-and-match items that you need, providing greater flexibility.</p>
    <p>Cards may be used in Primary Body, Secondary Body, Global Callout, or Page Callout. The design may be slightly different than illustrated here, due to differences of content.</p>
