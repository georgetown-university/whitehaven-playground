      A more flexible way to implement calls-to-action is to use Buttons. Full documentation is available on <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Buttons</a>, but here are some examples. Buttons are best used in Cards to provide a call-to-action, but can also be used alone in Primary or Secondary Body when attention is needed for a link. Buttons may also include additional code for icons, as illustrated here and described in more detail in the Icon section below.

      A more flexible way to implement callouts is to use Cards. Full documentation is available on <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Cards</a>, including Card Decks, but here are some examples based on GUâ€™s current callout styles. The Card functionality allows you to mix-and-match items that you need, providing greater flexibility. Cards may be used in Primary Body, Secondary Body, Global Callout, or Page Callout. The design may be slightly different than illustrated here, due to differences of content.
